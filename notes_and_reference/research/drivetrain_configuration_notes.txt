FWD, RWD, or AWD Configuration for performance vehicles
FWD:
- understeer
- torque steering
- mechanically simple
- more braking power with front axle because we brake with the motor

RWD:
- more acceleration off the line as weight shifts from front to back, the rear wheels gain traction
- power can be used to break traction on the rear wheels in corners

AWD:
- no chance in slipping in full power in off the line acceleration
- grip in corners is better
- battery placement and CG managment becomes harder to deal with
